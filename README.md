# TESTING THE APP
This app is being tested by Apple, so you can't download directly off the App Store yet. However, there is a way to test this app out. You will need to be using MacOS for these steps. On the main repo page, tap on code, and tap "Open with Xcode". Once opened, you can download it to your local iOS devices. Contact ekam@teamekam.org for any questions or information.

Here is a TestFlight link, however, it won't work until Apple has approved a build of the app: https://testflight.apple.com/join/xrZcJJ2y.
